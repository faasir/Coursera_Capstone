<h2> Introduction & the business problem</h2>

<p>Boston is the largest metropolitan City in the New England region. The Indian population is rapidly growing in the last two decades. Especially with all the Colleges and Universities in and around Boston and Boston being the home to many technology and Financial services companies, the Indian population in the Boston metro and surrounding area saw a rapid growth.</p>
    <p>Few investors came together and decided to invest in opening a new Indian Restaurant in Boston. The majority of the Indian population is the Boston Metro, Cambridge and Somerville areas. The investors have suggested 5 places in these neighborhoods and they believe that these are good choices. </p>
    <p>These investors hired me along with my team to identify a suitable location for this restaurant. And we are planning to use the techniques we have learned in the the past 8 courses. including the methods used in identifying, collecting, cleaning data, identifying the correct ML method to use to achieve the best outcome. Using the analysis, suggest the best location for the stake holders restaurant.<p>
